# Portfolio Page

## Description

This project is the initial creation of my Portfolio webpage containing all my experience, projects, contact info, resume, etc. The project was made with my knowledge of the CSS and HTML I have learned throughout the years and most recently from my Bootcamp course.

The navigation bar is interactive with CSS elements such as box shadow and a custom cursor I made in Krita for this webpage. In the future I hope to add a glow to the cursor using Javascript. Speaking of custom graphics, the background image for thw webpage was also created in Krita for this project.

I experimented with Flexbox to allow for the display of the main content of the page on the right without interfering with the navigation menu positioned on the left. The current featured project
